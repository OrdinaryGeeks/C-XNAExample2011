# CSharp-XNAExample2011
This is the final game that I made for XNA contest.  When I finally had a grasp of what to do, the contest went away.  This is a game where the black lines keep you from moving forward (collision map).  The blue guys go around killing unarmored guys.  The sample is online at my youtube. 

Edit:

After looking at the files, this has several game ideas that I had that were using the same models.  Orderly Tactics, Eternal Struggle, RTAS, Free Throw Game (TC SPorts)
